"Bro bro, are you serious you have ditched raymond Band for the polyester snitch paint which is not comfortable.",2
Dont compare snitch with zara na h&m,2
Propaganda video advertising for snitch 😊,1
Snitch & The Bear House are two of my favourites.,5
"Very good podcast. Because you folks are talking about basics, look out for wellbi, one to look out for them!",5
TBH their quality is decreased after getting investment from Shark Tank.,2
Insider buying snitch products and then returning the products....no one has heard abt Snitch. Raymond is good.,1
"Such bad quality of clothes. Excellent fashion, bad quality. Returned almost all of them back",1
❤❤❤,5
Worst quality,1
So happy to see these Indian entrepreneurs rise 😊😊 If all goes right India will definitely become a manufacturing powerhouse eventually. All the best to you guys👍🏻👍🏻,5

Beautiful amazing inspiration 🎉 very proud to be an indian family ❤SNITCH just love it 🫶🤜🤛,5
Can see how Indian youth are moving towards making India proud with such Companies.,4
quality of snitch cloths is So So,2
Snitch is the most unique fashion brand that has ever operated in India.  50% of my last 1 year's clothing has been from Snitch only.,5
"I think its not even near it, a better comparison of h&m would be with zudio which has somewhat same collection",2
Anyone who has bought from them once will never buy from them again. The design and quality does not even compare to westside and zara.,1
I have recently purchased clothes from Snitch Offline  store in Mangalore. I must their Quality and fit is top notch. I just loved it.,5
Our ceo is rocking the apparel industry ❤,5
"This is really inspiring. SNITCH is one of the best fashion brands in India! Their clothes are loud, unlike all the boring clothes out there. Hats off to the CEO!🫡",5
Snitch Kare lit 😎❤,5

HIgh Quality and Affordable Such A Great Initiative by Snitch..!!❤,5
"Quality degraded to be honest. I used to love their shirts, not anymore ! They are more of a economic brand now.",2
"Worst site for online shopping, worst customer service charge rupees for exchange cloth",1
No comparison with westside. Stop glorifying such brands and ideologies,1
"I’ve tried Snitch clothes They are just useless piece of shit They are growing just with hype, and if they continue so, soon they will bite the dust",1
"Everybody see revenue , no one wants to see the struggle 😂",2
Sorry but i am agaist fast fashion brands like this because they are destroying environment massively,4
Wow what a treat to watch Snitch rise. I saw him on Shark tank and his clarity is simply amazing.,5
Overpriced h and m better,2
"WHAT IS THE COMPARISION BETWEEN ZARA AND SNITCH . COMPARE SNITCH WITH BEWAKOOF, WRONG, THE INDIAN GARRAGE, ETC.",3
